--ROLES VS. PRIVELEGES--
	- Privelege - permission given to individual or group to perform a certain action
	- Role - set of privileges given to user

--AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS--
	- LDAP
	- inMemory
	- userDetails

--SPRING PASSWORD ENCODERS--
	- BCryptPasswordEncoder
		- generate random salt each time then hashes the password
		- much secure than SHA and recommended by the spring documentation
	- NoOpPasswordEncoder
		- does nothing, only used for testing purposes
	- StandardPasswordEncoder
		- uses SHA

--REST
	- REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer (SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol)
	- data or information in the server are treated as resources
	- the actual object is not transfered but a representation of it in the form of (json, xml, text, html)
	- resources are accessed using Http methods

	1) GET:- Used when the client is requesting a resource on the Web server.

	2) HEAD:- Used when the client is requesting some information about a resource but not requesting the resource itself.

	3) POST:- Used when the client is sending information or data to the serverâ€”for example, filling out an online form (i.e. Sends a large amount of complex data to the Web Server).

	4) PUT:- Used when the client is sending a replacement document or uploading a new document to the Web server under the request URL.

	5) DELETE:- Used when the client is trying to delete a document from the Web server, identified by the request URL.

	6) TRACE:- Used when the client is asking the available proxies or intermediate servers changing the request to announce themselves.

	7) OPTIONS:- Used when the client wants to determine other available methods to retrieve or process a document on the Web server.

	8) CONNECT:- Used when the client wants to establish a transparent connection to a remote host, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an HTTP proxy.

	Http request methods inform server on what to do with the request
